# Welcome to GetSecurity <small class="text-muted">.. information security documentation for everyone</small>

> This site is setup to provide free, self-serve, living, collaborative Information Security documentation.  

The inspiration behind it is basic, namely, we simply are not applying [Information Security Essentials](start-here.md) in our workplace, and instead, we are chasing after fancy Cyber Security solutions, AI and Machine Learning.  I'm definitely not against any of that, but if we can't even get our [Password Policy](password-policy.md) right, we are putting people's privacy, and our company at risk!

This is a personal project site, in my field of work, however, it is **much bigger than me**, and so it is also open to more skilled and experienced security practitioners and writers who wish to get involved.  Please contribute, see below.
 
Why not check out [Getting Started](start-here.md) to learn about the **5 Essential Security safeguards**.

Documentation provided on this site will follow industry standards, based on [ISO 27001:2013](https://www.iso.org/home.html), [Australian Signals Directorate (ASD)](https://www.asd.gov.au/infosec/acsc.htm),  [SANS](https://www.sans.org/), [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/), [CIS](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/), [National Cyber Security Center (NCSC)](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/), as well as Privacy Laws like GDPR.

## Who is this for?

* It's for those that don't know where to [begin](start-here.md) in Information Security.
* It's for those that love documentation and want to help the internet save lives.
* It's for lower resourced, start-ups to small business Information Security and Privacy teams to provide **free essential security requirements, that you can apply to your workplace ASAP**.
* It's for those implementing an ISMS.

Even big business, don't have the basics sorted, which is apparent in all of the public data breaches, so you should also take a look at this site.

## Want to contribute?

Awesome, because together we can make the internet a safer place!

Side note:  I have actually never hosted a collaborative repository, so i definitely need help how this works, and to provide collaborators the best workflow possible.</div>
