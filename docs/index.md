# Welcome to GetSecurity <small class="text-muted">.. get it?</small>

> This site is setup to provide free, self-serve, living, collaborative Information Security documentation.  

The inspiration behind it is basic, namely, we simply are not applying [Information Security Essentials](start-here.md) in our workplace, and instead, we are chasing after fancy Cyber Security solutions, AI and Machine Learning.  I'm definitely not against any of that, but if we can't even get our [Password Policy](password-policy.md) right, we are putting people's privacy, and our company at risk!

This is a personal project site in my field of work, however, it is much bigger than me, and so it is also open to more skilled and experienced security practitioners who wish to get involved.  Please contribute, see below.

This is not a blog site, instead a documentation site, for you to read like a book and apply where necessary.

Why not check out [Getting Started](start-here.md) to learn about the **5 Essential Security safeguards**.

Documentation provided on this site will follow industry standards, based on [ISO 27001:2013](https://www.iso.org/home.html), [Australian Signals Directorate (ASD)](https://www.asd.gov.au/infosec/acsc.htm),  [SANS](https://www.sans.org/), [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/), [CIS](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/), [National Cyber Security Center (NCSC)](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/), as well as Privacy Laws like GDPR.

## Who is this for?

It's for you and your organisation!

If you work in, or are interested in Cyber/Information Security or Information Privacy don't know where to start, [begin here](start-here.md).

These pages are primarily for lower resourced, start-ups to small business Information Security and Privacy teams to provide free essential security requirements to apply to your workplace.

Even big business, don't have the basics sorted, which is apparent in all of the public data breaches, so you should also take a look at this site.

## Want to contribute?

Awesome, because i need help!  I need your help writing chapters and topics.

So.. I guess clone it, write it, then submit a pull request.

However, I am a github beginner, so please contact me through an "issue" to help setup the contribution piece.
