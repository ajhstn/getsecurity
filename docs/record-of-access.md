# Record of Access

It's a good idea to come up with a process to record who has access to your systems.


* Start with a documented form to collect access request to your systems.
* Nominate an Asset Owner who will approve/deny requests for access.  The Asset Owner needs to **understand**, **comprehend** and **own** this responsibility.
* Document a log or register of who has access to what in the.
* who requested access
* why it was requested
* what level of access was requested
* what level was given (only give the minimum access required to perform job description)
* if additional access was given, document why
* dates (requested, actioned, revoked) etc
* sign off from asset owner

1. Review the register quarterly to ensure its accuracy and integrity.
