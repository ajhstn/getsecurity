# Security Essentials 

I mentioned on the home page about fancy Cyber Tech, well it's definitely super cool.  I love reading those blogs about how to "hunt", red & blue teams, penetration testing and toolings, truly epic.. All of that stuff is awesome, but it targets a very specific organisation and skill-set, not to mention the sponsorship required to implement it.

I feel the huge majority of businesses in every sector, every vertical and every corner of our round globe, need something else.

> **And so this site is all about the work required BEFORE an organisation, business or start-up invests in the cool stuff.**

In this article I will talk about the **absolute essentials** that you need to put in place in your business, and you need to do it before buying the glamourous tech mentioned above.

## 1. Know who you are

It all starts with this. This is all about the business.  If you don’t know what’s at the core of the business you work for, go and find out.  Go and meet with the right people and understand the purpose behind the existence of the company.  

> Side Note, if you don’t already know this.. pause..  If Info. Sec. is just a job for you, I hope and pray this article gets you some inspiration and brings your joy back!

## 2. Know what you have

Now that we know who we are, lets identify what we have.

This is all about stock take, inventory and asset registers.  **Go and document an inventory of the things you need to protect.**

> We can only protect what we know about.

## 3. Know who has access to it

This is all about process. **Go and record a document of who has access to what.**

> How do you protect an information asset if you don’t know who has access to it and what level of access they have?

## 4. Know what’s happening

This is all about auditing and logging.  **Go and log what's happening in your netowrk and environment.**

## 0. Know your people

Lastly, but possibly priority zero, you have to know your internal customer and employees.  This is all about training and spending time with real people. **Go and look at their workflow, teach them, coach them in the “how's” and “why's” of Information Security.**
