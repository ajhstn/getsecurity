# Welcome to GetSecurity

This site is setup to provide live, collaborative information security documentation.  It is a personal project site in my field of work, but is also open to more skilled and experienced practitioners who wish to get involved.  Please contribute, see below.

You will find "Getting Started" guidance as well as technical implemntation documentation, tooling options and scripting resources.

Documentation provided on this site will follow industry standards, based on [ISO 27001:2013](https://www.iso.org/home.html), [Australian Signals Directorate (ASD)](https://www.asd.gov.au/infosec/acsc.htm),  [SANS](https://www.sans.org/), [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/), [CIS](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/), [National Cyber Security Center (NCSC)](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/)

## Who is this for?

These pages are for low resourced information security and privacy teams to provide free essential security requirements to apply to your workplace.

## Want to contribute?

I am a github beginner, so please contact me through an "issue" to help setup the contribution piece.
